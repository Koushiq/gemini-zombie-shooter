1. All work will be done in a feature branch created from `master`.
2. Feature branches will be named `feature/feature-number`.
3. Commit messages will include the feature name and its status.
4. Before pushing, I will verify that all necessary files and changes have been staged and committed using `git status` and `git diff --staged`.
5. Feature branches will be pushed to the remote `origin`.
6. I will notify you to create a merge request on GitHub after pushing a feature branch.
7. A build pipeline will be used to automate testing.
